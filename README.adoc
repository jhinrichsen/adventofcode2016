= Advent Of Code (AOC) 2016

== Day 1

There's no grid, no 2D array, no X and Y variables, and no direction. Like.

Did not understand part 2, failing unit tests because i only marked end
positions. Only when i https://goplay.space[turtle graphic'ed] the example it
became clear that all steps count.

== Day 4

Part 2 needs to find sector ID of room "north pole objects". After finding
nothing, dumping all decrypted rooms, grep'ing for "north" one finally finds
the correct room "northpole object storage".
