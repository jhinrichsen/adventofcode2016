= Advent Of Code (AOC) 2016

== Day 1

There's no grid, no 2D array, no X and Y variables, and no direction. Like.

Did not understand part 2, failing unit tests because i only marked end
positions. Only when i https://goplay.space[turtle graphic'ed] the example it
became clear that all steps count.

== Day 4

Part 2 needs to find sector ID of room "north pole objects". After finding
nothing, dumping all decrypted rooms, grep'ing for "north" one finally finds
the correct room "northpole object storage".

Use a 26 bytes array to count letter occurences instead of a sparse map[byte]uint:

Part #1 is 100% faster, part #2 300 % faster.

1381 nanoseconds (ns) are 1.4 microseconds (μs).
Light will travel around 500 meters in 1.6 μs.
I mean this is incredibly fast, nay?
